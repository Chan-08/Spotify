## Features

- **Day Mode**: Users can toggle between dark mode and light mode by clicking the "Toggle Mode" button. The day mode alters the color scheme to a lighter theme for better visibility during the day.

- **Responsiveness**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes:
  - On screens narrower than 768px, the sidebar is hidden to optimize space.
  - Playlist items adjust their width on smaller screens (less than 568px) for better usability.

- **Navigation**: The `id` attributes used in the HTML provide smooth navigation within the page:
  - **`#playlistforu`**: Navigates to the "Playlist for you" section.
  - **`#rep`**: Navigates to the "On Repeat" section.

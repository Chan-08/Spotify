```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chan-08/Spotify.git

# Navigate to the project directory

# Open the index.html file in your browser
```

## Usage

After setting up the project, open `index.html` in your browser to view the application. 

- **Toggle Mode**: Click the "Toggle Mode" button in the sidebar to switch between day mode and dark mode.
- **Audio Controls**: Click on the play/pause icons to control audio playback for each playlist item.

## Features

- **Day Mode**: Users can toggle between dark mode and light mode by clicking the "Toggle Mode" button. The day mode alters the color scheme to a lighter theme for better visibility during the day.

- **Responsiveness**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes:
  - On screens narrower than 768px, the sidebar is hidden to optimize space.
  - Playlist items adjust their width on smaller screens (less than 568px) for better usability.

- **Navigation**: The `id` attributes used in the HTML provide smooth navigation within the page:
  - **`#playlistforu`**: Navigates to the "Playlist for you" section.
  - **`#rep`**: Navigates to the "On Repeat" section.
